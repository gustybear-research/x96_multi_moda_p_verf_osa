# Vital-Based Continuous Identity Verification with Heterogeneous Sensing Modalities

This project implements **MASCOT**, the first **M**od**A**lity-**S**witch **CO**mpliance **T**racking system for at-home OSA screening. MASCOT safeguards OSA test compliance by identifying and tracking the patient's breathing pattern among multiple targets, with the tracking modalities adapts to the patient's activity and changes between a traditional contact-based compliance tracker and the PRMS. It leverages the patient's unique, instantaneous breathing patterns to prevent ambiguity during modality switches and establishes/renews a shared secret key to secure the exchange of test compliance tracking records between modalities.
